This file provides detailed instructions on how to set up and run this project from a fresh download (e.g., after downloading it as a ZIP from GitHub).

**Prerequisites:**
*   Node.js and npm: https://nodejs.org/
*   Python: https://www.python.org/

---

### **Step 1: Download and Unzip**

1.  Download the project ZIP from your GitHub repository.
2.  Unzip the contents to a location on your computer. For these instructions, we will assume you have unzipped it to `C:\Users\bhage\Desktop\AITutor-from-zip`.

---

### **Step 2: Set up the Frontend**

1.  **Navigate to the project directory in a terminal:**
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\bhage\Desktop\AITutor-from-zip
    ```

2.  **Install the frontend dependencies:**
    *   This command reads the `package.json` file and downloads all the necessary libraries for the frontend.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

---

### **Step 3: Set up the Backend**

*All of these commands should be run from the same terminal, still inside the main project directory (`C:\Users\bhage\Desktop\AITutor-from-zip`)*

1.  **Create a Python virtual environment:**
    *   This creates an isolated environment for the backend's Python packages, preventing conflicts with other projects.
    ```bash
    python -m venv backend\venv
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    *   This command activates the virtual environment's `pip` to install all the libraries listed in `backend/requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    .\backend\venv\Scripts\pip install -r backend\requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Create the environment variables file:**
    *   This file stores your secret API key.
    *   Create a new file named `.env` inside the `backend` folder (`C:\Users\bhage\Desktop\AITutor-from-zip\backend\.env`).
    *   Add the following line to the file, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

4.  **Create the database:**
    *   This command uses the migration files to create the `app.db` file and set up all the necessary tables.
    *   First, you need to set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable. Create a file named `.flaskenv` in the root project directory (`C:\Users\bhage\Desktop\AITutor-from-zip\.flaskenv`) and add this line:
    ```
    FLASK_APP=backend
    ```
    *   Now, run the database upgrade command:
    ```bash
    .\backend\venv\Scripts\flask db upgrade
    ```

---

### **Step 4: Run the Application**

*You will need two separate terminals open at the same time.*

**Terminal 1: Run the Backend Server**

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\bhage\Desktop\AITutor-from-zip
    ```
2.  **Run the Flask server:**
    ```bash
    .\backend\venv\Scripts\flask run
    ```
    *   Leave this terminal running. You should see output indicating it is running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

**Terminal 2: Run the Frontend Application**

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\bhage\Desktop\AITutor-from-zip
    ```
2.  **Run the Vite development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    *   This will automatically open the application in your web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can now use the application.
