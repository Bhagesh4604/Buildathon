Here are the steps to deploy your application on Render:

1.  **Push your code to a GitHub repository.**
    *   Make sure you have committed all the changes, including the new `requirements.txt`, `build.sh`, and `Procfile`.

2.  **Create a new Web Service on Render:**
    *   Go to the Render dashboard and click 'New +'.
    *   Select 'Web Service'.
    *   Connect your GitHub account and select your repository.

3.  **Configure the service:**
    *   **Name:** Give your service a name (e.g., 'nxt-tutor').
    *   **Region:** Choose a region that is geographically close to your users.
    *   **Branch:** Select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., 'main').
    *   **Build Command:** `bash build.sh`
    *   **Start Command:** `flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=$PORT`

4.  **Add Environment Variables:**
    *   Click on the 'Environment' tab.
    *   Add the following environment variables:
        *   `FLASK_APP`: `backend`
        *   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Gemini API key.
        *   `PYTHON_VERSION`: I recommend `3.10.0`, but you can use any version supported by Render.
        *   `SECRET_KEY`: A long, random string for Flask's session security. You can generate one using a password generator.

5.  **Deploy:**
    *   Click the 'Create Web Service' button. Render will start building and deploying your application.

After the deployment is complete, your application will be available at the URL provided by Render.
